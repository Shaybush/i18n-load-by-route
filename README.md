# i18n-load-by-route

This project demonstrates an efficient method for managing internationalization (i18n) resources in a React application using `i18next` and `react-router-dom`. The key goal is to load only the necessary translation files for the current route and language, which significantly improves performance and memory usage.

## ðŸŽ¯ What This Project Solves

In large-scale applications with many routes and languages, loading all translation files at once can lead to:

- **High initial load times**: Users wait longer for the app to become interactive.
- **Increased memory consumption**: Unnecessary data is stored in memory.
- **Slow performance**: The browser has to parse and handle large JSON objects.

This project implements a strategy where translation files (namespaces) are loaded on-demand based on the current route.

## âœ¨ Key Features & Benefits

- **On-Demand Loading**: Only the translations for the current page are loaded.
- **Automatic Cleanup**: When navigating to a new page, the translations for the previous page are automatically removed from memory.
- **Language Switching**: Seamlessly switch languages on any page. The system automatically loads the correct resources for the new language.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Keeps the memory footprint minimal by only storing the currently needed translations.
- **Scalability**: The approach scales well as more routes and languages are added to the application.
